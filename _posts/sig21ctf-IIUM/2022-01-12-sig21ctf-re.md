## Flag 1.
We were given a binary file to download named `cr4ckm3001`
simply running strings on the file then search for the flag format will us the flag
```bash
strings cr4ckm3001 | grep "sig21CTF{.*}"
sig21CTF{5c006c88c9e49482e94e4232b0c5a90a8217648d3d3fc90c8ff73b40150716d3}

```
## Flag 2.
Ok this challenge is a little bit hard. running strings doest give us the flag. So its about time to use some real RE tools (as the challenge suggested). So for this challenge i will be using radare(r2). 

```bash
r2 cr4ckm3002
aaaa -> to analize the binary
vb -> to print functions
```
Inspecting the entro of the program aka main() should give us the flag.<br>

## Flag 3.
Opening the main in r2 we can see the assembly code. <br>

### Step 1.
We move $dword to $aex 
$aex = 0x1346936 <br>
0x1346936 to decimal == 20212022

### Step 2.
we compare if $edx == $aex
```cpp
if (input == 202122) {print success} 
else {print failure}
```
then we jne (jump not equal) to the failure mesage.
So theoritically if we supply 20212022 we should get a success msg.

### Step 3.
We print Failure

## Flag

```bash
echo "20212022" | md5sum
dca92a085ebc8a1a668c08a4954e1dd0
flag: sig21CTF{dca92a085ebc8a1a668c08a4954e1dd0}
```
